The Admin Account Interface must be enhanced to fully reflect and support advanced management functionalities across the system. The following key improvements are required:

🔧 1. Navigation Bar Enhancements
Update the navigation bar to accurately display all advanced features, including:

Bulk Upload Books (ensure it's visible to admin and correctly named)

Manage Books with complete functionality

Manage Users, Manage Categories, Manage Orders

Analytics Dashboard, Review Moderation, and Notification Panel

Advanced Search functionality

Remove Authors and Wishlist from the admin's navigation view, as they are not relevant to admin operations.

📚 2. Manage Books – Full Action Support
Ensure the Manage Books section supports all three admin actions:

View – Should open the detailed book information without error.

Edit – Allow admins to update book details.

Delete – Securely remove a book from the system.

Fix the 500 Internal Server Error that occurs when clicking View. This should properly render book details or show a meaningful message if data is missing.

📂 3. Bulk Upload Books
Ensure the "Bulk Upload Books" option is visible and accessible in the admin dashboard.

Rename it to exactly: Bulk Upload Books.

Provide a downloadable Excel/CSV template for uploading multiple books. The template must include the following columns:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Title | ISBN | Author | Publisher | Price | Discount Price | Description | Category | Pages | Edition | Language | Stock Quantity | Image URL | Rating
📦 4. Manage Orders – Visibility & Action Fixes
Fix the content rendering issue in the Manage Orders page — all order details must be visible.

Enable functional action buttons (View, Update Status, Cancel, etc.) to allow full control over customer orders.

👥 5. Manage Users – Error Resolution
Resolve the 500 Internal Server Error occurring in the Manage Users section.

Enable full functionality:

View and manage user profiles

Promote/demote roles

Deactivate or reset accounts

View order/feedback history of users

🛠️ 6. Image-Based Features – Ensure Functional Integration
Activate and integrate image features that support:

Display of author photos on author pages

Display of book cover images in book listings, orders, and suggestions

Ensure broken or missing images are replaced with a default placeholder.
